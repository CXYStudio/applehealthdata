Extract Data from Apple Health App's XML Export

Discussed in blog posts at http://tdda.info, including:

  * v1.0: http://www.tdda.info/in-defence-of-xml-exporting-and-analysing-apple-health-data




Various commits are tagged with version numbers of the form v1.0 etc,
so you can check out a particular version with

    $ git checkout v1.0

etc., provided you pull the tags

    $ git pull --tags

if your copy of git isn't set up to do this by default.
